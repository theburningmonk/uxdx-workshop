# Module 4: More learning resources

This is a really gentle introduction to Serverless development using the Serverless framework, there's only so much we can actually cover in 1.5hrs.

But if you have any other questions, then feel free to ask me now.

I also run a more comprehensive workshop that teaches you everything you need to know to build production-ready serverless applications. To see the next available workshop, go to [www.productionreadyserverless.com](https://www.productionreadyserverless.com).
